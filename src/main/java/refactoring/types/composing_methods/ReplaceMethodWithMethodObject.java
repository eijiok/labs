 * <h1>Replace Method with Method Object</h1>

 * <p><strong>Solution</strong>: Transform the method into a separate class so that the local variables become fields of the class. Then you can split the method into several methods within the same class.</p>
 * <br />
 * <p><strong>Task</strong>: Delegate to <i>PriceCalculator</i> the calculation of price</p>
